I'm a practice lead at [KPMG Microsoft Business solutions](https://home.kpmg/mt/en/home/services/microsoft-business-solutions.html), who is perpetually curious about anything that is engineering, programming and ai. I'm particularly interested in soft computing and its applications in machine learning and robotics.

This is  a place where I keep notes and references on the projects that I work on, in an attempt to learn properly, organize, motivate myself and hopefully help people working on similar topics.
