Inspired by a post by Cal Newport I have set a goal of reading five three a month. I would like to move to a place where reading is my default activity and hopefully I can attain and expand my goal in the future.
I have started with the following books:

### Gomorrah
#### Roberto Saviano


### Another 12 Rules for Life
#### Jordan B. Peterson

- Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement.
- Imagine who you could be and then aim single-mindedly at that.
- Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.
- Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.
- Do not do what you hate.
- Abandon ideology.
- Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.
- Try to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible.
- If old memories still upset you, write them down carefully and completely.
- Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship.
- Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant.
- Be grateful in spite of your suffering.
