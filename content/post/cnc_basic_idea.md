So this is my journey in building my CNC machine. It is something that I always wanted to do actually, I think that every robotics enthusiast is fascinated by this tool. Obviously I was inspired by a number of CNC projects over the web:

1. [Homo Faciens](https://homofaciens.de/index_en.htm) This is the base site for every robotics/electronics enthusiast. Lots of tutorials, projects and ideas. Everything is very clearly explained. My first goto page when I need some idea or inspiration
2. [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-CNC-Machine/) by koff1979  very good and  thorough explanation of his machine.
3. [NYC CNC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0IyK4ntgdPTTjsxjvyHPg) youtube channel in particular this video

there are many other sources out there, I will add more as I go along

There are also a number of tool sites that are very interesting, I am listing the first one that I found and hopefully I will have an entry with all the tools that I am using somewhere:

* [Makercam](https://www.makercam.com/) . Great web based tool for CNC system operation. Here is a good, albeit verbose video tutorial.
