I finally found the time and will to put some order where I work with electronics. This is how it is looking:


![My workbench](../workdesk.jpg)

I found the shelf at Lidl and it was a perfect fit on the bench. Some of the tools that I have:

1. My ancient Trio 25Mhz dual channel oscilloscope. I bought this one 33 years ago and it has been a faithful companion over the years.
2. Variable bench power supply. E-bay.
3. Function generator. E-Bay.
4. Beco Soldering station.
5. USB oscilloscope. Not best out there but very comfortable and I am using it a lot lately.
6. Anicubic Kossel 3D printer. Not the easiest printer out there but I love the flexibility that it offers.
7. Home made power supplied from computer PSUs. 
8. A couple of multimeters
