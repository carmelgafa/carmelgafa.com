In the [previous post](/post/azureml_training/) of this series, we have seen how to create an execute a machine learning experiment in AzureML. Our experiment was by no means a real ML experiment, but a simple script that printed a message.

In this post, we will see how to create and execute a ML experiment that actually involves training a model. It is important to note that this post is just the first step in the process of creating a proper ML pipeline in AzureML and is therefore not the best of solutions. In future posts, we will continue improving this process and create a better ML pipeline in AzureML.
