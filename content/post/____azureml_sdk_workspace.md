Data scientists and AI developers use the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python to build and run machine learning workflows with the Azure Machine Learning service. You can interact with the service in any Python environment, including Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code, or your favorite Python IDE.


Key areas of the SDK include:

Explore, prepare and manage the lifecycle of your datasets used in machine learning experiments.
Manage cloud resources for monitoring, logging, and organizing your machine learning experiments.
Train models either locally or by using cloud resources, including GPU-accelerated model training.
Use automated machine learning, which accepts configuration parameters and training data. It automatically iterates through algorithms and hyperparameter settings to find the best model for running predictions.
Deploy web services to convert your trained models into RESTful services that can be consumed in any application.
