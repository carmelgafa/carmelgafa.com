The MXChip IoT Devkit byt Microsoft is a very interesting device, loaded with sensors and promises easy setup.

I followed the Microsoft [tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/get-started/) to have a first look at the device, and indeed it was extremely straightforward process. I am writing this as I am approaching the end of the tutorial so not to forget any points:

1. Install Arduino studio 1.8.8. When I tried the 1.8.11 I was getting a *Could not initialize class com.sun.jna.Native* error that was not given when I switched to the older 1.8.8
