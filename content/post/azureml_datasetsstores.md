In AzureML, the two important concepts that help us work with data are Datastores and Datasets.

- Datastores are used for storing connection information to Azure storage services
- Datasets are references to the location of the data source.

Azure has various locations for storing data. such as;

- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Datafactory
- Azure Databricks

These are the places where the data can exist.
