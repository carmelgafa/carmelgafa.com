On October 28, 1940, at around 3:00 am, the Italian ambassador to Greece issued an ultimatum, but before it expired, Mussolini's forces attacked from Albania, expecting a swift victory. The Greek army mounted a fierce resistance, aided by the bad weather, and successfully pushed the Italians back. This unexpected Greek success marked the first significant Allied land victory against the Axis powers and boosted morale among the Allies.

The Greeks mocked Mussolini as they drove his forces back into Albania during the Greco-Italian War. The Greek counteroffensive, which began after repelling the initial Italian invasion, turned into a significant embarrassment for Mussolini and his regime, which had anticipated a swift and easy victory. One famous way the Greeks mocked Mussolini was through the popular slogan "Ohi," meaning "No," commemorating their refusal to surrender. October 28 became a national holiday known as "Ohi Day." Greek newspapers, cartoons, and public discourse ridiculed Mussolini's failed military ambitions, boosting national morale and showcasing the resilience of the Greek people in the face of foreign aggression.

However, the situation changed in April 1941 when Nazi Germany launched Operation Marita to support its faltering Italian ally. The German invasion overwhelmed Greek defences, and by the end of April 1941, Greece was fully occupied by Axis forces.

On a recent visit to the Athens War Museum, I was impressed by the extensive collection of artifacts related to the Greco-Italian War and Greece's involvement in World War II. Walking through the exhibits provided a comprehensive understanding of the bravery and resilience of the Greek people during this tumultuous time.

The museum, established to honour the Greek armed forces and their historical contributions, offers extensive displays on various conflicts, including WWII. I found the military uniforms, weapons, maps, photographs, and personal items belonging to soldiers and civilians from that era particularly insightful. Each item highlighted the courage and sacrifice of those involved. Detailed exhibits on key battles, strategies, and the broader context of Greece's role in the war brought the history vividly to life. This visit was not just an educational experience but a testament to the enduring spirit and significant contributions of Greece during World War II.
