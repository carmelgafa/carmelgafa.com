title: Hugo Static Site Generator
description: My Notes Page
summary: Notes I took when learning Hugo
---

This site was done using [Hugo static code generator](https://gohugo.io/) and the hugo [personal-web theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/personal-web/) by Baptiste Jacquemet .

I previously had a custom site that I built using Angular and .NET that was difficult to maintain, so I ended up spending more time tinkering with the code than on content. For this reason I looked at a couple of options and finally settled on Hugo.

I am also using [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com/) and obviously github for my CI/CD pipeline. Editing is done using Visual Studio Code.

I got an idea on how to use Hugo from the [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) by Mike Dane .

Below are some notes that I took for my reference.
