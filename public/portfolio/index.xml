      <description>Robot Uan
  Design Considerations The purpose of designing and constructing this robot was to provide a generic test-bed for robot controller design and testing.Unlike most robot platforms used in education or research, UAN does not come with its proprietary development environment but uses Microsoft .NET Mobile edition, thus programming is done using the wide spread .NET framework from Microsoft.
The challenge addressed by UAN is that changing to a different robot or to a different platform does not necessarily mean a complete change in paradigm, and a substantial part of the knowledge and code can be transferred to the new platform.</description>
