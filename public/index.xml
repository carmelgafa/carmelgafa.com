      <description>On October 28, 1940, at around 3:00 am, the Italian ambassador to Greece issued an ultimatum, but before it expired, Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s forces attacked from Albania, expecting a swift victory. The Greek army mounted a fierce resistance, aided by the bad weather, and successfully pushed the Italians back. This unexpected Greek success marked the first significant Allied land victory against the Axis powers and boosted morale among the Allies.&#xA;Benelli Italian motorcycle used in WW2 The Greeks mocked Mussolini as they drove his forces back into Albania during the Greco-Italian War.</description>

      <description>Logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for binary classification tasks.&#xA;Given a feature vector $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$, the goal of logistic regression is to predict the probability $\hat{y}$ that a binary output variable $y$ takes the value 1, given $X$, that is $\hat{y} = P(y=1|X)$, $0\le y\le1$. For example, in the case of image classification, logistic regression can be used to predict the probability that an image contains a cat.</description>

      <description>Introduction After completing the model selection and optimization phase, the next step is to evaluate the final_model using the test dataset. The evaluation process involves executing the full pipeline to transform the test features and predict the corresponding labels. It is expected that the model&amp;rsquo;s performance on the test dataset will be slightly lower than that on the training and validation datasets.&#xA;The evaluation process is similar to the previous phases, where the models and test data are loaded, and the pipeline is executed to obtain the test predictors.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this second part of this series of posts, we will optimize the model we created in the previously by selecting the best set of hyperparameters, or model configuration parameters, that affect the training process. Hyperparameters differ from model parameters in that they are not learnt through some automated process but are chosen by the data scientist. In general, we cannot use techniques to understand model parameters, such as gradient descent, to learn hyperparameters, although they ultimately affect the loss function as well.</description>

      <description>This post will look at Interval Type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) and its reduction. We have already discussed the basics of Type-2 fuzzy sets in a previous post, and we have seen that a general type-2 fuzzy set can be defined as follows:&#xA;$$\tilde{A}=\int_{x\in X}\int_{u\in J_{x}} \mu_{\tilde{A}}(x,u) / (x,u)$$&#xA;where $J_{x}\subseteq[0,1]$&#xA;And if, as an example, we consider the following general type-2 fuzzy set:&#xA;(1.0/0 + 0.5/0.2 + 0.3/0.4 + 0.1/0.6 )/1+ (0.</description>

      <description>The paper by Wagner and Hagras explains the concept of zSlices as a way to implement type-2 fuzzy logic systems based on general type-2 fuzzy sets. The paper&amp;rsquo;s appendices contain numeric examples of centroid computation based on zSlices. This post describes the steps involved in implementing the paper by Wagner and Hagras. It also lists the results obtained and compares them with those listed in the original document.&#xA;Centroid of a zSliced Based Type-2 Set The general type-2 fuzzy set used in these examples will result in the potential computation of the centroid of $3^{11}$ wavy slices.</description>

Our experiment was not an actual ML experiment but a simple script that printed a message.&#xA;This post will see how to create and execute an ML experiment that involves training a model. It is important to note that this post is just the first step in creating a proper ML pipeline in AzureML and is therefore not the best of solutions.</description>

      <description>**In this series of posts we have discussed the basics of linear regression and they introduced the gradient descent algorithm. We have also discussed the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and the mini-batch gradient descent as variations of batch gradient descent that can possibly reduce the time to convergence of the algorithm.&#xA;In this post we will summarize what we have discussed so far, and focus on the results that we have obtained from the various gradient descent algorithms.</description>

      <description>In the last post we compared the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to the batch gradient descent algorithm that we has discussed in a previous post. We discussed that as the size of the training dataset increases, batch gradient descent, where we use all the examples of the training set in each iteration, becomes very computationally expensive and that we can therefore use stochastic gradient descent, where we use one example of the training set in each iteration, to have a more efficient way to approach the coefficients of our hypothesis function.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, we have discussed the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression applied to multiple features. As the size of the training dataset increases, gradient descent becomes very computationally expensive. In particular, if we consider the computation of the cost function,&#xA;$$J = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( \hat{y}^{(i)} - {y}^{(i)} \right)^2$$,&#xA;which is a calculation that we need to compute for each training data iteration; we can can see that the cost function is expensive as m increases.</description>

AutoML makes it possible for people who do not have coding experience to develop and use ML models.&#xA;In a typical machine learning application, we start with raw data for Training. The data might have missing fields, contain outliers, and require cleaning work. The following steps might be required:</description>

      <description>This post is a continuation of a previous post where the cost functions used in linear regression scenarios are used. We will start by revisiting the mean square error (MSE) cost function;&#xA;$$MSE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \hat{y}_i-y_i )^{2} }{n}$$&#xA;which, as explained in the previous post, is&#xA;$$MSE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-a_0-a_1 x_i)^{2} }{n}$$&#xA;The objective is to adjust $a_0$ and $a_1$ such that the MSE is minimized. This is achieved by deriving the MSE with respect to $a_0$ and $a_1$, and finding the minimum case by equating to zero.</description>

      <description>The objective of regression is to fit a line through a given data set. Hence, if we are given a set of points;&#xA;$$ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_i, y_i), \dots ,(x_n, y_n)$$&#xA;we want to fit the line $\hat{y} = a_0 + a_1 x$ through the given set of data. The equation $ a_0 + a_1 x$ is known as the hypothesis function.&#xA;It would be trivial if a line could exactly represent the data provided.</description>

      <description>This article was first published in Towards Data Science.&#xA;Introduction In a previous post, we have seen how we use a fuzzy set of type-1 when we cannot determine the membership of an element as 0 or 1. We can extend this concept when the circumstances are so fuzzy that we have trouble determining the membership grade as a number in [0, 1]. In these cases, type-2 fuzzy sets provide the necessary framework to formalize and work with this information.</description>

      <description>Pierre de Fermat 1607-1665 was a French lawyer and mathematician. In 1640, he proposed a problem to Evangelista Torricelli, a student of the famous Galileo Galilei. Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the point in a triangle whose sum of distances from the vertices is a minimum. Torricelli did solve the problem, in more than a single way, but over the years other solutions where found. In 1937, Endre Weitzfeld came up with an algorithmic solution of this problem, that we shall look into in this post.</description>

      <description>A binary classifier is a function that can be applied to features X to produce a Y value of true (1) or false (0). It is a supervised learning technique; therefore, a test set is extracted from the available data so that the model is validated before deployed in production.&#xA;$$ f(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n) = Y \in {0, 1} $$&#xA;The function will return a value between 0 and 1, and a threshold value is therefore operated to classify the result as a true or false.</description>

      <description>This article was first published in Towards Data Science.&#xA;Introduction Many tasks are simple for humans, but they create a continuous challenge for machines. Examples of such systems include walking through a cluttered environment, lifting fragile objects or parking a car. The ability of humans to deal with vague and imprecise data makes such tasks easy for us. Therefore if we aim to replicate the control actions of a human operator, we must be able to model the activities of the operator and not of the plant itself.</description>

      <description>I am currently extending my Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Library so that fuzzy controllers can be implemented through its codebase. The implementation is straightforward if you have the correct structures in place; using an inference system, the most popular of which was discussed by Mamdani (Mamdani, Ebrahim H. &amp;ldquo;Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant.&amp;rdquo; Proceedings of the institution of electrical engineers. Vol. 121. No. 12. IET, 1974.). An illustration of the Mamdani inference system operation is below (taken from wikipedia):</description>

For example, Age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e.,young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old and not very young, etc., rather than 20, 21,22, 23 (Zadeh, Lotfi Asker.</description>

      <description>The CNC machine under consideration is a light-duty one, that should cut wood or perspex with widths less than 6mm. For this reason the design is simplified as much as possible as the main objective of this exercise is to probe the concept before considering a more robust one.&#xA;The machine will be built from the scap wood and the metal parts (bearings etc.) will be bought from ebay. An arduino with a CNC shield will be used to drive the stepper motors.</description>

      <description>There are two basic movement mechanisms that are used by CNC machines.&#xA;The first is a moving X-Y table moving under a tool that can move only in the Z direction (up and down). This mechanism was used by Nick Kennard in his machine.&#xA;Alternatively the tool is moved in the X-Y-Z directions. An example of such machine is the one built by Doug Costlow in his instructable .&#xA;Finally hybrids of the two types mentioned above exist, where a table moving only in the X direction whilst the tool moved in the Y and Z axes.</description>

      <description>Design Considerations The purpose of designing and constructing this robot was to provide a generic test-bed for robot controller design and testing.Unlike most robot platforms used in education or research, UAN does not come with its proprietary development environment but uses Microsoft .NET Mobile edition, thus programming is done using the wide spread .NET framework from Microsoft.&#xA;The challenge addressed by UAN is that changing to a different robot or to a different platform does not necessarily mean a complete change in paradigm, and a substantial part of the knowledge and code can be transferred to the new platform.</description>

      <description>The high level design goal of this work is the creation of an autonomous robot navigation toolkit which is flexible, robust, easy to use and to configure and preferably independent of the sensors and actuators utilized. More information about the system can be found in this presentation.&#xA;The first component that is required is a physical robot. Although considerable testing and verification of the navigation algorithms used can be achieved through the use of a simulation tool, the only valid validation mechanism is an actual robot with real sensors and actuators.</description>
